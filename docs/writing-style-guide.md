# Writing Style Guide

## Tone and Voice

**Direct and matter-of-fact.** No embellishment, no trying to impress. State what you did and why.

**Honest.** Don't oversell. If you don't have concrete metrics, don't make performance claims.

**Technical but concise.** Audience is developers. Skip basic explanations, but don't be verbose.

## What to Avoid

- **Em dashes (—)** - Use colons, periods, or commas instead
- **Editorializing about other platforms** - Don't trash Medium, Substack, etc. Just state what you wanted
- **Inflated claims** - "Under 1000 lines" or "really fast" without backing it up
- **ChatGPT-isms** - "Let's dive in", "In this post, we'll explore", overly structured intros
- **Unnecessary qualifiers** - "simply", "just", "easily" (use sparingly)

## Structure

**Short paragraphs.** 2-3 sentences max for most paragraphs.

**Variety in formatting:**
- Code blocks for examples
- Blockquotes for stats or key points
- Lists for enumerating features or steps
- Headers to break up sections

**Start sections with substance.** No "In this section" or "Now let's talk about". Jump straight in.

## Technical Content

**Show, don't just tell.** Include code examples, commands, actual frontmatter.

**Be specific.** "1200px max width, 85% JPEG quality" not "optimized images".

**Link to external references.** Tools, libraries, benchmarks - link them.

## Opening and Closing

**Opening:** Get to the point quickly. What did you build and why.

**Closing:** Brief reflection. No grand conclusions or calls to action.
